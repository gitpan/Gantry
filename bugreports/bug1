The following problem was caused by the CGI engine trying to bless
the second arg to its constructor when it is undefined.  To correct it,
I made {} the default second argument if the first argument is false.

I thank You so much!!!
I installed Gantry at home and it worked almost from the first time
There is a problem thought You would like to know about.
When I tried to run the example from the QuickStart, the following
does not work:

    my $cgi = Gantry::Engine::CGI->new();
    $cgi->add_location( '/', 'HiWorld' );
    $cgi->dispatch();


After changing it to:
  my $cgi = Gantry::Engine::CGI->new( {locations=>{'/', 'HiWorld'}} );
  $cgi->dispatch();

it worked

Additionally I would like to ask you what are the plans for the future
of Gantry.
I have to admit that I am really looking for for a complete solution
upon which I would like to build a CMS or/and (why not) an Application
server :) .

I was doing Apache::ASP programming for about an year. Apache::ASP is
mature and reliable but lacks things like Class::DBI and TinyMCE.
Ofcourse it was not its purpose but this is another question.

At present I am hired by a company where I am doing TYPO3 extension programming.
TYPO3 is a PHP based CMS/Framework which is rather evolved, but is so
unnatural for me that makes me screem from time to time! :)
However there are things which are good enough ;) to "steal"...

And  of course  I will try Bigtop.

Thanks again!!! I will write what happened
