3.19
	- Modified Build.PL. Now copies all files in the root folder.
    - Updated the Gantry::Conf api so you can get location level
      config.
    - Corrected the mechanism for using Gantry::Conf so mulitple
      instances in the same server can really have different conf.

3.18
 	- Documentation updates
3.17
	- tied Gantry::Conf to the framework
    - added initial Gantry::Conf code and stubs for the future 
    - Updated constraint handling in AutoCRUD and CRUD to use the
      current Data::FormValidator constraint_methods key.
    - Updated Gantry::Conf to use ConfigureVia Method insteadn of
      ConfigureViaMethod which allows for multiple ConfigureVia statements
      in the same instance block and easier dispatching.

3.16
	- added PODViewer 
    - CGI Engine fix, casting error to wrong method
	- fixed prompt problem when installing within CPAN shell

3.15 Thu Feb 16 09:22:03 CST 2006
	- add paging.ttc ( paging for the results.tt )
    - added cgi parameter parsing code
	- Added lots of Docs modules
    - Refactored handler and init so that all conf fishing and other
      engine specific code is actually in the engines not Gantry.pm

3.14 Wed Feb  1 08:09:54 CST 2006
	- modified engines
	- added CGI::Simple object to all
	- improved cgi error messages
    - restored connection info scheme having found the bug (mod_perl
      helpers were still caching the conn_info data, so everyone was
      going to the first database hit)
    - renamed Gantry::Utils::ModelHelper to Gantry::Utils::DBConnHelper
      to better reflect what it helps with (renamed all it subclasses too)
    - added Gantry::Utils::Model as a Class::DBI replacement
    - added Gantry::Utils::ModelHelper to provide db_Main and other
      useful methods as mixins to Gantry::Utils::Model::* modules.
    Note that no production app uses Gantry::Utils::Model yet.
    - removed accessors in Gantry.pm for dbconn, dbuser, and dbpass

3.13 Fri Jan 20 13:27:21 CST 2006
    - Added script auth connection handling to db_Main in AuthCDBI util.
    - Added doc stubs in modules.

3.12 Thu Jan 19 10:44:31 CST 2006
    - Added retreive_all_for_main_listing to Gantry::Utils::AuthCDBI
      which we needed to do since we separated Malcolm's auth models
      from the regular ones.

3.09 - 3.11
	- AuthCDBI, CBDI testing

3.08
  	- Add Access auth module ( Gantry::Control::C::Access )
      provides IP authentication for mod_perl.
	- updates to pod
	- updates to Template Default
    - Changed connection info scheme for regular and cgi scripts
      in Gantry::Utils::CDBI.  This required moving connection info
      fishing from init_cgi in Gantry.pm to Gantry::Engine::CGI->new
    - Expanded the connection info scheme change to all engine types
      by introducting Gantry::Utils::ModelHelper as a (mostly) abstract
      base class from which a new module for each engine inherits
    - Expanded connection info scheme to the auth db connecitons.
      CGI may not be working correctly under the new scheme.

3.07 Mon Dec 26 12:19:05 CST 2005
 	- Add CGI Engine. ( Gantry::Engine::CGI );
	  Gantry apps can now run under CGI (including Fast-CGI)

3.06 Tue Dec 20 12:47:47 CST 2005
    - Revised Build.PL so that it complains more quietly if
      File::Recursive::Copy is not installed.
    - Revised use test section for mod_perl 1.9x so it checks for
      Apache::Request before trying to use the engine, yielding a cleaner
      error message.
	- Change auth front-end modules to use $self->location for redirect_to_main
	  instead of $self->apps_rootp . '/blah'
	  
3.05 Thu Dec 15 12:08:42 CST 2005
	- template toolkit object is now unique per location block.
	- converted front-end auth modules to use Gantry CRUD
	- added editor_init.ttc ( default tinymce editor componet )
	- modified form.tt to handle the editor_init.ttc componet

3.04 Fri Dec  9 17:04:05 CST 2005
    - Corrected template error which gave very small widths to text input
      fields by default (hint: TT uses size as a pseudo-method)

    - Minor template revisions

      of our framework in production for multiple apps.

    - Changed Gantry::user_row to return nothing when it can't find a user.

0.25 Wed Nov 16 11:46:53 CST 2005
    - Added Gantry::Plugins::CRUD for more control.
    - Corrected relocate so you have more control of where it takes you
      from successful AutoCRUD actions.
    - Corrected error which had boolean select lists always showing
      their default values instead of showing those only when the
      database didn't have a value.
