==========================

Gantry is a Perl Web App Framework.

See Gantry::Docs::QuickStart to get started.

INSTALLATION

To install this module:

    perl Build.PL
    ./Build
    ./Build test
    ./Build install

During installation you will be asked for a 'Web Directory'.  Gantry
uses this to store templates for its CRUD schemes and other things.
It is called a 'Web Directory' since your web server must be willing
to serve files from it.  Typically, it is enough to make this a subdirectory
of your document root.
