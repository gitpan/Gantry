This directory has the source for the Gantry book and its figures.
You need latex to build the book.  Then you can run the buildbook script.
When you do that it will litter as latex is prone to do.

The key files are:

    outline  - a text file listing all the files the make up the book
    book.tex - the top level tex file which describes the book
    *.tex    - the chapters in the book
    *.eps    - the figures for the book in encapsulated postscript form
