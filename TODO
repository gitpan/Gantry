Gantry::Utils::Model needs some more features:
    caching (but users can always override the retrieve and construct methods)
    place holders in SQL (or any SQL caching)
    has_many
        items (a method which returns a list of the associated items)
        add_to_items
        cascading update
        cascading delete

DONE:
    Abstract out all references to the apache request object.  This object
    is subject to mod_perl api changes.  Further, other systems don't have
    this option.  What we need is a way to set config variables and have
    them show up in the app in an engine independent way.
        This is still not finished because there is no accessor for the
        hostname in the engines.
        Acutally, there is a base_server in each engine which performs
        this task.

    Requests for auth db conn info should fall back on regular db conn info if
    auth forms aren't defined.
        Not really tested, but the change didn't break the existing test app.

    AutoCRUD should try to call form, then fallback to _form if that fails.

    When all elements on a form are optional, you can't add or edit rows
    with AutoCRUD or CRUD.

    Missing template is not displaying its error correctly in MP13 engine
    (works in CGI).
        Headers were sent at the wrong time.  Tim fixed it.

    Fix Gantry::Utils::DB, module should not export subs
        that module was abandoned in favor of better schemes

    Fix all Auth modules

    Make it possible for different modules in the same app to use different
    template engines (think TT and plain).
        $self->content_type( 'text/plain' );  # or 'text/xml' etc.
        $self->template_disable( 1 );
